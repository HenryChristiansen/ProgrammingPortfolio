1. TDGAME
2. TDGAME is a survival tower defense game. You are a movable character (W,A,S,D) and use (LMB) to shoot enemies that are attacking you. You start with 100 HP which you cannot    ---regen, but you can buy a player shield in the build menu to protect your precious health. You use (E) or (RMB) to open the options to build turrets, which range from many --------options including machine guns, teslas, bombs, lasers, traps, etc. As time goes on, the levels increase in difficulty and there is a boss every 5 levels. After each level there ---is a grace period which you have time to buy and prepare. If you die you can revive for twice the cost every time you die, starting at $1000. If you are dead, the enemies will ---attack your turrets until they are destroyed, at which point you have lost.
