# Group Project:
1. TDGAME
2. TDGAME is a survival tower defense game. You are a movable character (W,A,S,D) and use (LMB) to shoot enemies that are attacking you. You start with 100 HP which you cannot regen, but you can buy a player shield in the build menu to protect your precious health. You use (E) or (RMB) to open the options to build turrets, which range from many options including machine guns, teslas, bombs, lasers, traps, etc. As time goes on, the levels increase in difficulty and there is a boss every 5 levels. After each level there is a grace period which you have time to buy and prepare. If you die you can revive for twice the cost every time you die, starting at $1000. If you are dead, the enemies will attack your turrets until they are destroyed, at which point you have lost.

# Individual Project Number 1:
1. Projectile Motion Calculator
2. A scientific calculator that can calculate information about an object in projectile motion given initial values. It can also graph the motion of this projectile and give    your information about this projectile at a given time.

# Individual Project Number 2:
1. Guessing Game
2. A fun game where a random number betweeen 0 and 100 is generated and you (as the user) have to guess this number. The game keeps track of your name, number of guesses, and the time it took you to guess the correct number and keeps record of the person who guesses the number the fastest.
3. Mockups/Documentation: No planning or mockups were made for this application. It is a console application.

# Individual Project Number 3:
1. Triangle Drawer
2. A simple graphical application that allows you to draw triangles with your mouse. It is very simple and fun to mess around with.
3. Mockups/Documentation: No planning or mockups were made for this application. It is a simple graphical application.
